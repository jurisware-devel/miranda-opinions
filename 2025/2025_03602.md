{**44 NY3d at 1000} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

"In the context of a Grand Jury proceeding, legal sufficiency means prima facie proof of the crimes charged, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt" (People v Bello, 92 NY2d 523, 526 [1998] [citations omitted]). "The reviewing court's inquiry is limited to whether the facts, if proven, and the inferences that logically flow from those facts supply proof of every element of the charged crimes . . . ." (Id. [internal quotation marks omitted].) "That other, innocent inferences could possibly be drawn from [the evidence presented to the grand jury] is irrelevant to the sufficiency inquiry where, as here, the Grand Jury could rationally have drawn the guilty inference" ([3]People v Edwards, 36 NY3d 946, 947 [2020] [internal quotation marks omitted]).

The evidence presented to the grand jury was legally sufficient to demonstrate that defendant acted with depraved{**44 NY3d at 1001} indifference to human life (see Penal Law §§ 125.25 [2]; 120.25). "[A] person who is depravedly indifferent is not just willing to take a grossly unreasonable risk to human life—that person does not care how the risk turns out" ([4]People v Maldonado, 24 NY3d 48, 53 [2014], quoting [5]People v Lewie, 17 NY3d 348, 359 [2011]). Defendant's arguments are essentially challenges to the weight of the evidence, and thus not properly considered on appellate review of a challenge to the legal sufficiency of an indictment (see People v Swamp, 84 NY2d 725, 730 [1995] ["The reviewing court must . . . defer( ) all questions as to the weight or quality of the evidence"]). Even considering only the evidence as to which defendant raises no admissibility objections, we conclude that the evidence [*2]presented to the grand jury was sufficient to establish prima facie proof of the crimes charged (see People v Avant, 33 NY2d 265, 271 [1973]).

Chief Judge Wilson and Judges Rivera, Garcia, Singas, Cannataro, Troutman and Halligan concur.

Order affirmed, in a memorandum.
