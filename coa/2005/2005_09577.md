On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), appeal dismissed as moot. The People's claims regarding the Appellate Division's order vacating defendant's sentence were rendered academic when County Court resentenced defendant to the same term imposed by its original judgment.
