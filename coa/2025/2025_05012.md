Decided September 18, 2025

[2]People v Paulino, 233 AD3d 6, affirmed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Twyla Carter, The Legal Aid Society, New York City (Graham Ball of counsel), for appellant.

Darcel D. Clark, District Attorney, Bronx (Rafael Curbelo of counsel), for respondent.

{**44 NY3d at 1040} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

Defendant was convicted of attempted murder in the second degree (Penal Law §§ 110.00; 125.25 [1]). His sole contention on appeal to the Appellate Division was that his sentence is unduly harsh and severe and should be reduced in the interest of justice. The Appellate Division, over a two-Justice dissent, affirmed (233 AD3d 6 [1st Dept 2024]). It reasoned that while it "unquestionably" has the authority to reduce a sentence in the interest of justice "even in the absence of a sentencing court's abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances," exercising that authority was unwarranted because defendant's sentence "is neither unduly harsh nor excessive" (id. at 8-9). The Appellate Division therefore applied the correct legal standard to defendant's claim, and its responses to the dissent do not suggest otherwise (see [People v Brisman, 43 NY3d 322, 324 [2025]](https://miranda.jurisware.com/case/2025_00123/)). We have no basis to further review the Appellate Division's determination (see id. at 324-325).

Chief Judge Wilson and Judges Rivera, Garcia, Singas, Cannataro, Troutman and Halligan concur.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR), order affirmed, in a memorandum. [*2]
