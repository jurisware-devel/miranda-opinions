Decided November 24, 2009

[2]People v Tabb, 59 AD3d 1080, reversed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, Inc., Buffalo (Robert B. Hallborg, Jr.,
David C. Schopp and Barbara J. Davies of counsel), for appellant.

Frank A. Sedita, III, District Attorney, Buffalo (Raymond C. Herman of
counsel), for respondent.

{**13 NY3d at 853} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.

During deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial court that asked for direction on, or an explanation of, "the legal definition of self defense." Nothing in the record indicates that the court informed defense counsel and the prosecutor about the contents of the note. In the [*2]absence of record proof that the trial court complied with its core responsibilities under CPL 310.30, a mode of proceedings error occurred requiring reversal ([3]see e.g. People v Kisoon, 8 NY3d 129, 135 [2007]; People v O'Rama, 78 NY2d 270, 277 [1991]).

Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur in memorandum.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order reversed, etc.
