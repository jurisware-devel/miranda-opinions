The People of the State of New York, Respondent,
v
Danny Martin, Appellant.

Decided June 26, 2012

[2]People v Martin, 88 AD3d 473, affirmed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, New York City (Mei Lin Kwan-Gett and
James F. Caputo of counsel), and Legal Aid Society of New York (Denise
Fabiano and Steven Banks of counsel) for appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York City (Jared Wolkowitz
and Sheila O'Shea of counsel), for respondent.

{**19 NY3d at 915} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed (see People v De Bour, 40 NY2d 210 [1976]). Whether Detective Barnes{**19 NY3d at 916} had a founded suspicion to approach defendant, or probable cause to arrest him involve mixed questions of law and fact, beyond our review if the determination is supported by the record. Because such record evidence exists here, the issues are beyond further review by this Court.

Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order affirmed in a memorandum.
