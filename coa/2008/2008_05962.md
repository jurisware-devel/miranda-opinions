{**10 NY3d at 945} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.{**10 NY3d at 946}

The courts below did not err in declining to suppress the cocaine recovered from the defendant's car. The record supports the finding that the officer who stopped the car reasonably believed the windows to be over-tinted in violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law § 375 (12-a) (b) (3). The [*2]officer was not chargeable with knowledge that the tinting was legal in Georgia, where the car was registered.

Defendant's other contentions also lack merit.

Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order affirmed, in a memorandum.
