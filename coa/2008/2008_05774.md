v
Andrew Packer, Respondent.

Decided June 25, 2008

[2]People v Packer, 49 AD3d 184, affirmed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Robert M. Morgenthau, District Attorney, New York City (Eric Rosen and
Sheryl Feldman of counsel), for appellant.

Legal Aid Society, New York City (Ellen Dille of counsel), for
respondent.

{**10 NY3d at 916} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

The court's determination—that defendant's consent was involuntarily given because it was insufficiently distinguishable from the illegal frisk—finds record support. The People's contention that the court applied an erroneous legal standard is unavailing. [*2]

Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order affirmed, in a memorandum. .
