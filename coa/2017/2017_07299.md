The People of the State of New York, Respondent,
v
James L. Carr, Appellant.

Argued September 6, 2017; decided October 19, 2017

[2]People v Carr, 128 AD3d 1402, affirmed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Evan M. Lumley, Buffalo, for appellant.

Michael J. Flaherty, Jr., Acting District Attorney, Buffalo (Nicholas
T. Texido and Michael J. Hillery of counsel), for respondent.

{**30 NY3d at 946} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

There was no error in the denial of defendant's motion to vacate the judgment. Under these circumstances, the People were not required to seek court permission under CPL 190.75 (3) before presenting additional charges to a second grand jury. We do not pass upon [*2]whether a CPL 440.10 motion lies to bring this claim, as that question is not before us.

Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Stein, Garcia, Wilson and Feinman concur; Judge Fahey taking no part.

Order affirmed, in a memorandum.
