[*1]

The People of the State of New York, Appellant,
v
Robert L. Ingram, Respondent.

Decided December 16, 2014

[2]People v Ingram, 114 AD3d 1290, affirmed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Frank A. Sedita, III, District Attorney, Buffalo (David A. Heraty of
counsel), for appellant.

Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, Inc., Buffalo (Sherry A. Chase of
counsel), for respondent.

{**24 NY3d at 1107} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

The determination whether police have reasonable suspicion to justify a stop involves a mixed question of law and fact (People v Woods, 98 NY2d 627, 628 [2002]). Where, as here, there exists record support for the Appellate Division's resolution of this question, the issue is beyond this Court's further review.

Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Read, Smith, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order affirmed, in a memorandum.
