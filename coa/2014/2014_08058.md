v
Karen M. Caza, Appellant.

Decided November 20, 2014

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Martin J. McGuinness, Queensbury, for appellant.

Respondent precluded.

{**24 NY3d at 1057}OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed. Defendant's argument that County Court erred in enhancing her sentence by departing from its conditional promise to make her two terms of imprisonment run concurrently is unpreserved for our review (see CPL [*2]470.05 [2]; [3]People v Hawkins, 11 NY3d 484, 491-493 [2008]).

Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order affirmed, in a memorandum.
