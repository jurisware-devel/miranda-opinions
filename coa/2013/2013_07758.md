{**22 NY3d at 981} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

Defendant's argument that his Alford plea should not have been accepted because [*2]the record does not contain strong evidence of his actual guilt is unpreserved for our review as he has moved neither to withdraw his plea nor to vacate the judgment{**22 NY3d at 982} of conviction ([3]see People v Louree, 8 NY3d 541, 545 [2007]; People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665-666 [1988]).

Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur.

Order affirmed, in a memorandum.
