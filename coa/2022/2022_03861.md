{**38 NY3d at 1129} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.{**38 NY3d at 1130}

Under the unique circumstances presented, Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion in reserving decision on the People's pretrial Molineux application which sought to cross-examine defendant regarding the underlying facts of his prior gun-related convictions until after defendant's testimony, at which time the court could determine whether, and to what extent, defendant opened the door to such inquiry (see People v Molineux, 168 NY 264, 294 [1901]; People v Ingram, 71 NY2d 474, 479 [1988]). In any event, any error that may have occurred in the court's Molineux rulings was harmless (see [People v Grant, 7 NY3d 421, 424-426 [2006]](https://miranda.jurisware.com/case/2006_07394/)).

Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Garcia, Singas, Cannataro and Troutman concur; Judge Wilson dissents and votes to reverse and order a new trial, for reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of Justice Cheryl E. Chambers at the Appellate Division (186 AD3d 731, 734-740 [2d Dept 2020, Chambers, J.P., dissenting]).

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order affirmed, in a memorandum.
