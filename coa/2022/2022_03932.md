Decided June 16, 2022

SUMMARY

Statement of Case

Appeal, by permission of a Justice of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department, from an order of that
Court, entered December 16, 2021. The Appellate Division affirmed a
judgment of the Schenectady County Court (Matthew J. Sypniewski, J.),
which had convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of assault in the
first degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, and
criminal mischief in the fourth degree.

[2]People v Serrano, 200 AD3d 1340, affirmed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Steven M. Sharp, Albany, for appellant.

Robert M. Carney, District Attorney, Schenectady (Peter H. Willis of
counsel), for respondent.

{**38 NY3d at 1180} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed. County Court properly denied defendant's request to charge assault in the third degree (Penal Law § 120.00 [1]) as a lesser included offense of assault in the first degree ([see People v Almonte, 33 NY3d 1083, 1084 [2019]](https://miranda.jurisware.com/case/2019_05185/)). Furthermore, defendant received effective assistance of counsel (see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712-715 [1998]). Defendant's remaining contentions, in particular his challenges to the admission of certain testimony, are unpreserved or waived.

Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Garcia, Wilson, Singas, Cannataro and Troutman concur.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order affirmed, in a memorandum.
