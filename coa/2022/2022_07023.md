On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order reversed and accusatory instrument dismissed. As the People acknowledge, the accusatory instrument's misdemeanor count, to which defendant pleaded guilty, was facially deficient ([3]see People v Hill, 38 NY3d 460, 462 [2022]). The People consent to dismissal of the remaining portion of the accusatory instrument.

Concur: Acting Chief Judge Cannataro and Judges Rivera, Garcia, Wilson, Singas and Troutman.
