The People of the State of New York, Respondent,
v
Kysean Stroud, Appellant.

Decided June 14, 2022

[2]People v Stroud, 200 AD3d 1629, affirmed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Connors LLP, Buffalo (Terrence M. Connors, Rebecca F. Izzo and Kelly E.
Riley of counsel), for appellant.

John J. Flynn, District Attorney, Buffalo (Matthew B. Powers of
counsel), for respondent.

{**38 NY3d at 1130} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

A determination of reasonable suspicion is a mixed question of law and fact which is beyond our further review if there is legally sufficient record support for the determinations of the courts below ([see People v Parker, 32 NY3d 49, 55 [2018]](https://miranda.jurisware.com/case/2018_04776/)). The record contains support for the lower courts' finding of reasonable suspicion to stop the car in which defendant was a passenger (see People v Chestnut, 43 AD2d 260 [3d Dept 1974], affd 36 NY2d 971 [1975]). Defendant's remaining contention lacks merit.

Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Garcia, Wilson, Singas, and Cannataro concur. Judge Troutman took no part.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order affirmed, in a memorandum.
