APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

James A. McCarty, Acting District Attorney, White Plains (Laurie
Sapakoff of counsel), for respondent.

{**28 NY3d at 1035} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed. Supreme Court had jurisdiction over the case when it corrected an error in a decision issued one day prior based on [*2]an objective fact and thereby reinstated certain counts of defendant's indictment. Accordingly, there is no basis to disturb the judgment entered upon defendant's guilty plea.

Judges Pigott, Rivera, Abdus-Salaam, Stein, Fahey and Garcia concur; Chief Judge DiFiore taking no part.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order affirmed, in a memorandum.
