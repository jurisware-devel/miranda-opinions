[2]People v Panton, 114 AD3d 450, affirmed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Robert S. Dean, Center for Appellate Litigation, New York City (Robin
Nichinsky of counsel), for appellant.

of counsel), and Robert T. Johnson, District Attorney, Bronx (Joseph N.

{**27 NY3d at 1144} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

Defendant contends that police engaged in improper pre-Miranda custodial interrogation and, as a result, her post-{**27 NY3d at 1145}Miranda written and video statements should have been suppressed. Because defendant did [*2]not raise this particular ground either in her suppression motion or at the hearing, it is unpreserved for our review (see People v Gonzalez, 55 NY2d 887, 888 [1982]).

We have considered defendant's remaining contention and find it to be without merit.

Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Pigott, Rivera, Abdus-Salaam, Stein, Fahey and Garcia concur.

Order affirmed, in a memorandum.
