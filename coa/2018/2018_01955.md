Michael Johnson, Appellant.

Argued February 6, 2018; decided March 22, 2018

[2]People v Johnson, 139 AD3d 967, affirmed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Michael Johnson, pro se, and Appellate Advocates, New York City (De
Nice Powell and Lynn W.L. Fahey of counsel), for Michael Johnson,
appellant.

Richard A. Brown, District Attorney, Kew Gardens (Nancy Fitzpatrick
Talcott, Robert J. Masters and Joseph N. Ferdenzi of counsel), for
respondent.

{**31 NY3d at 943} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The Appellate Division order should be affirmed.

Defendant Michael Johnson appeals from the Appellate Division order affirming two judgments of conviction and sentence. On the facts of this case, assuming without deciding that the trial court erroneously denied defendant's motion to suppress, any such error was harmless (see People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230 [1975]). Defendant's other claims of trial error and prosecutorial misconduct are without merit (see CPL 240.50; People v Almodovar, 62 NY2d 126, 133 [1984]; People v Davis, 58 NY2d 1102, 1104 [1983]).

Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Stein, Fahey, Garcia, Wilson and Feinman concur.

Order affirmed, in a memorandum.
