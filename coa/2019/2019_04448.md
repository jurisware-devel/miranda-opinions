of counsel), for respondent.

{**33 NY3d at 1016} OPINION OF THE COURT

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order reversed and case remitted to the Appellate Term, Second Department,{**33 NY3d at 1017} Second, Eleventh and Thirteenth Judicial Districts, for consideration of the facts and issues raised, but not determined, on the appeal to that court. The factual allegations in the accusatory instrument were sufficient to support the inference that defendant was the operator of the vehicle involved in the accident and, thus, Appellate Term erroneously dismissed the accusatory instrument on that ground.

Concur: Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Stein, Fahey, Garcia, Wilson and Feinman.
