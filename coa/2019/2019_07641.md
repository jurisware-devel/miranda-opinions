{**34 NY3d at 976} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

[1] It is undisputed that defendant failed to preserve for our review his contention that Executive Law § 552 violates the State Constitution (see CPL 470.05 [2]; [People v Davidson, 27 NY3d 1083, 1086 [2016]](https://miranda.jurisware.com/case/2016_04326/)). The Appellate Division declined to exercise its power to review that contention as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [a]), and we cannot reach that discretionary decision (see CPL 470.35 [1]). Defendant's further contention that he was denied meaningful representation is better addressed in a motion pursuant to CPL article 440 (see CPL 440.10 [1] [f], [h]; People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998]).

[2] Defendant's additional contention that his statements to investigators should have been suppressed as involuntary presents a mixed question of law and fact ([4]see Matter of Jimmy D., 15 NY3d 417, 423 [2010]). Inasmuch as there is record support for the determination of the suppression court that those statements were voluntary, that issue is beyond further review by this Court ([5]see Matter of Luis P., 32 NY3d 1165, 1166 [2018]).

Rivera, J. (concurring).

I agree the Appellate Division should be affirmed and join the majority's analysis with one exception. In my view, whether the Appellate Division may remit to create a record that it deems necessary to reach defendant's unpreserved claim presents a question of law reviewable in this appeal (CPL 470.35 [1]). On the merits, I perceive no error in the analysis below warranting reversal (see CPL 470.10; 470.15 [3] [c]; [6] [a]; 470.20).

Judges Stein, Fahey, Garcia, Wilson and Feinman concur; Judge Rivera concurs in result in an opinion; Chief Judge DiFiore taking no part.

Order affirmed, in a memorandum.
