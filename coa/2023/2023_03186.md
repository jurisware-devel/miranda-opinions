APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Center for Appellate Litigation, New York City (Megan D. Byrne of
counsel), for appellant.

Alvin L. Bragg, Jr., District Attorney, New York City (Michael J.
Yetter and Andrew E. Seewald of counsel), for respondent.

{**40 NY3d at 947} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and a new trial ordered. In contrast to [3]People v Duarte (37 NY3d 1218 [2022]), the trial court here recognized defendant as having unequivocally requested to proceed pro se. However, the court failed to conduct the required " 'searching inquiry' to ensure that the defendant's waiver [of the right to counsel] is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary" ([4]People v Silburn, 31 NY3d 144, 150 [2018] [some internal quotation marks omitted]).

Chief Judge Wilson and Judges Rivera, Garcia, Singas, Cannataro and Troutman concur. Judge Halligan took no part.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order reversed, and a new trial ordered, in a memorandum.
