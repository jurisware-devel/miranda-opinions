The People of the State of New York, Respondent,
v
Eugene Mendoza, Appellant.

Decided November 18, 2021

[2]People v Mendoza, 177 AD3d 773, reversed.

APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL

Patricia Pazner, Appellate Advocates, New York City (David Fitzmaurice
of counsel), for appellant.

Melinda Katz, District Attorney, Kew Gardens (William H. Branigan of
counsel), for respondent.

{**37 NY3d at 1075} OPINION OF THE COURT

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order reversed and case remitted to the Appellate Division, Second Department, for further proceedings. Under the totality of the circumstances and upon the People's concession, defendant's appeal waiver was invalid and therefore did not foreclose consideration of his harsh and excessive sentence claim ([3]see People v Bisono, 36 NY3d 1013, 1017-1018 [2020]).

Concur: Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Fahey, Garcia, Wilson, Singas and Cannataro.
