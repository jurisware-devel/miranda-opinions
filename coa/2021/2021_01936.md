{**36 NY3d at 1093} OPINION OF THE COURT

Memorandum.

The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed. Any error was harmless because, in the circumstances presented, the proof of defendant's guilt was overwhelming, even after excising the disputed evidence. Further, no reasonable possibility exists that admission of that evidence contributed to defendant's{**36 NY3d at 1094} conviction ([3]see People v Mairena, 34 NY3d 473, 484-485 [2019]; People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230, 237, 241-242 [1975]). Defendant's arguments concerning the weight of the evidence and the harshness of his sentence are not reviewable, and his other assertions are unavailing.

Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Stein, Fahey, Garcia and Wilson concur.

On review of submissions pursuant to section 500.11 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.11), order affirmed, in a memorandum.
